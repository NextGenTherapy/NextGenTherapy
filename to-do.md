   - Styled error messages with CSS modules

âœ… **Implemented dynamic imports**
   - Contact form now loads dynamically for better performance
   - Added loading spinner animation
   - Optimized bundle splitting

âœ… **Enhanced security features**
   - Rate limiting on contact API (10 requests per 15 minutes)
   - Input sanitization and validation
   - XSS protection and secure headers

## [Code Quality & Structure] âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **Converted all CSS to SCSS with centralized variables**
   - Installed SASS and converted all .css files to .scss
   - Created centralized variables.scss with comprehensive design tokens
   - Replaced all hardcoded values with CSS variables for easy theming
   - Added semantic color variables (success, error, warning, info, borders)

âœ… **Reorganized file structure for maintainability**
   - `/components/ui/` - UI elements (buttons, links)
   - `/components/forms/` - Form components
   - `/components/layout/` - Layout components (header, footer, cookie consent, error boundary)
   - `/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
   - `/types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

âœ… **Enhanced security and legal compliance**
   - Added comprehensive security headers in next.config.ts
   - Implemented GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner
   - Created detailed Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages
   - Added legal page links to footer

âœ… **Code quality improvements**
   - Added TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Implemented utility functions for form validation
   - Fixed all ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors
   - Removed unused variables and cleaned up codebase

## [Final Polish] âœ… COMPLETED

âœ… **All builds passing successfully**
âœ… **No ESLint warnings or errors**
âœ… **All files use CSS variables (no hardcoded values)**
âœ… **Proper file organization and clean import paths**
âœ… **Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub**

## Optional Future Enhancements

3. **Compress and resize all images in `/public/images/`** (Manual task)
   - [ ] Use an image optimizer (e.g., [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)) to reduce file size.
   - [ ] Ensure images are no larger than needed for their display size.
   
   **Note**: This is a manual optimization task. The images are already optimized by Next.js Image component, but you can further reduce file sizes using image compression tools.

4. **Advanced monitoring and analytics** (Future enhancement)
   - [ ] Add Google Analytics or similar tracking
   - [ ] Implement error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring
