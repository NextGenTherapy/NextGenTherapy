Therapy sessions provide a safe space to explore and work through anxiety, but what happens when you're faced with anxious thoughts and feelings between appointments? Learning to manage anxiety between sessions is a crucial part of your therapeutic journey and ongoing wellbeing.

## Understanding Anxiety Between Sessions

It's completely normal to experience anxiety between therapy sessions. In fact, it often indicates that:
- **Therapy is working**: You're processing important material
- **You're becoming more aware**: You're noticing patterns you might have previously ignored
- **Change is happening**: Growth can initially feel unsettling
- **You're building new skills**: Learning takes practice in real-world situations

## Common Triggers for Between-Session Anxiety

### Processing Session Content
- Difficult emotions brought up during therapy
- New insights that feel overwhelming
- Memories or feelings that surface after sessions
- Fear about what you might discover about yourself

### Daily Life Stressors
- Work or school pressures
- Relationship conflicts
- Financial concerns
- Health worries
- Major life transitions

### Anticipatory Anxiety
- Worrying about the next session
- Fear of disappointing your therapist
- Concern about being "too much" or "not enough"
- Uncertainty about the therapeutic process

## Immediate Coping Strategies

- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

**Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**
- Tense and release muscle groups starting with your toes
- Work your way up through your body
- Hold tension for 5 seconds, then release

**Body Scan:**
- Start at the top of your head

- Breathe into those areas

## Building Your Toolkit

### Journaling

**Stream of consciousness writing:**
- Set a timer for 10-15 minutes
- Write whatever comes to mind
- Don't worry about grammar or making sense
- This helps externalise anxious thoughts

**Structured journaling:**
- What am I feeling right now?
- What triggered this feeling?
- What would I tell a friend in this situation?
- What's one small thing I can do to help myself right now?

**Gratitude practice:**
- Write down three things you're grateful for
- Include why you're grateful for each item
- This helps shift focus from anxiety to appreciation

### Physical Activities

**Movement for anxiety:**
- Take a walk, especially in nature
- Do gentle yoga or stretching
- Dance to music you enjoy
- Clean or organise (productive movement can be soothing)

**Exercise benefits:**
- Releases endorphins (natural mood boosters)
- Provides a healthy outlet for anxious energy
- Improves sleep quality
- Builds confidence and sense of accomplishment

### Connection and Support

**Reach out to trusted people:**
- Call a friend or family member
- Join a support group
- Connect with your spiritual community if applicable
- Remember: asking for support is a strength, not a weakness

**Professional support:**
- Know when you can contact your therapist
- Understand your therapist's emergency contact procedures
- Consider additional resources like crisis helplines if needed

## Cognitive Strategies

### Challenging Anxious Thoughts

**Ask yourself:**
- Is this thought helpful or unhelpful?
- What evidence do I have for and against this thought?
- What would I tell a friend having this thought?
- What's the worst that could realistically happen?
- How likely is that worst-case scenario?

**Reframing techniques:**
- "I'm having the thought that..." (creates distance from the thought)
- "This feeling will pass" (reminds you of the temporary nature of emotions)
- "I can handle this" (builds confidence in your coping abilities)

### Planning and Problem-Solving

**For controllable worries:**
- Break the problem into smaller, manageable steps
- Focus on what you can influence
- Make a specific action plan
- Take one small step today

**For uncontrollable worries:**
- Practice acceptance: "I cannot control this outcome"
- Focus on your response: "I can control how I react"
- Use distraction techniques for rumination
- Practice letting go

## Creating Structure and Routine

### Daily anchors
- Consistent wake-up and bedtime
- Regular meals
- Scheduled self-care activities
- Time for relaxation or hobbies

### Weekly planning
- Schedule enjoyable activities
- Plan social connections
- Include time for reflection
- Balance activity with rest

## When to Seek Additional Support

Contact your therapist or seek immediate help if you experience:
- **Thoughts of self-harm or suicide**
- **Panic attacks that don't respond to your usual coping strategies**
- **Inability to function in daily activities**
- **Substance use as a coping mechanism**
- **Persistent insomnia or appetite changes**
- **Feeling completely overwhelmed despite using your tools**

## Remember

Managing anxiety between sessions is a skill that develops over time. Be patient with yourself as you learn what works best for you. Every time you successfully cope with anxiety using these tools, you're building confidence in your ability to handle difficult emotions.

Your anxiety doesn't define you, and you have more strength and resilience than you might realise. Each time you use these strategies, you're proving to yourself that you can handle difficult moments and that you're actively participating in your own healing.

The work you do between sessions is just as important as the work you do during therapy. You're learning to become your own therapist, developing the skills and confidence to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and self-compassion.

Trust the process, trust your ability to cope, and remember that seeking help and using these tools shows tremendous courage and wisdom.
