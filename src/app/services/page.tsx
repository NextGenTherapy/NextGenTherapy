              <p>
                As a qualified play therapist in Colchester, I provide children with a natural way to express their 
                feelings and work through challenges. Using toys, games, and creative 
                activities, children can explore difficult emotions in a safe, 
                supportive environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach is particularly effective for children who may struggle 
                to articulate their feelings verbally, helping them develop emotional 
                resilience and coping strategies.

              <h3>What should I expect in my first therapy session in Colchester?</h3>
              <p>
                Your first session with me as your Colchester therapist is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. 
                I&apos;ll ask about what brought you to therapy, your goals, and any concerns 
                you might have. We&apos;ll discuss confidentiality, how therapy works, and 
                answer any questions you have. There&apos;s no pressure to share more than 
                you&apos;re comfortable with.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.faqItem}>
              <h3>How long are therapy sessions?</h3>
              <p>
                Each therapy session lasts 50 minutes (the therapeutic hour). This gives 
                us enough time to explore your thoughts and feelings while maintaining 
                healthy boundaries. Sessions are scheduled weekly, though frequency can 
                be adjusted based on your individual needs.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.faqItem}>
              <h3>Is everything I say confidential?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, everything discussed in our sessions is strictly confidential. 
                I follow professional guidelines that protect your privacy. The only 
                exceptions would be if there&apos;s a risk of serious harm to yourself or 
                others, which I would discuss with you first whenever possible.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.faqItem}>
              <h3>How many sessions will I need?</h3>
              <p>
                The number of sessions varies for each person and depends on your individual 
                goals and circumstances. Some people find benefit in just a few sessions, 
                while others prefer longer-term support. We&apos;ll regularly review your 
                progress together and you&apos;re free to end therapy whenever you feel ready.

              <h3>Do you offer online therapy sessions as a Colchester therapist?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, as a qualified therapist in Colchester, I offer both in-person sessions at my Colchester practice and secure online 
                sessions via video call. Online therapy can be just as effective as 
                in-person sessions and offers flexibility for those with busy schedules

              <h3>What&apos;s the difference between play therapy and talking therapy?</h3>
              <p>
                Play therapy is designed specifically for children and uses toys, games, 
                and creative activities as the primary way of communication. Children 
                often express themselves more naturally through play than words. Talking 
                therapy for adults and teenagers focuses on verbal communication to 
                explore thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

            <div className={styles.faqItem}>
              <h3>How do I know if therapy is right for me?</h3>
              <p>
                If you&apos;re struggling with your mental health, feeling stuck, or want 
                to understand yourself better, therapy can help. You don&apos;t need to be 
                in crisis to benefit from therapy. It&apos;s a space for personal growth, 
                developing coping strategies, and improving your overall well-being.

              <h3>What if I don&apos;t know what to talk about?</h3>
              <p>
                That&apos;s completely normal and absolutely fine. I&apos;m here to help guide 
                our conversations and create a safe space for you to explore your 
                thoughts and feelings. Many people worry about this, but you&apos;ll find 
                that once we start talking, things naturally emerge.
