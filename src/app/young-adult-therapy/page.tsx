                <h2>Understanding the Young Adult Journey</h2>
                <p>
                  Your twenties and early thirties can feel like you&apos;re supposed to have
                  everything figured out, but the reality is often very different. This is a time of
                  significant transitionâ€”finishing education, starting careers, forming serious
                  relationships, and establishing independence. It&apos;s exciting but can also feel
                  overwhelming and isolating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my practice in Colchester, I work with young adults who are navigating these
                  complex life transitions. Whether you&apos;re struggling with anxiety about the
                  future, feeling stuck in your career, dealing with relationship challenges, or
                  questioning your life direction, therapy can provide clarity and support during
                  this transformative time.

                  Working with young adults means understanding the unique pressures of this life
                  stage while respecting your autonomy and goals. I provide a space where you can
                  explore your feelings and experiences without judgment, helping you develop the
                  insights and skills needed to navigate this complex time with greater confidence.
