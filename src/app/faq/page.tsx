      question: "How much does therapy cost in Colchester?",
      answer: "Individual therapy sessions are Â£60 for 50 minutes. I also offer a free 15-minute consultation call to discuss your needs and see if we're a good fit to work together."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer online therapy sessions?",
      answer: "Yes, I offer both in-person sessions in Colchester and online therapy sessions via secure video calls. Online therapy can be just as effective as face-to-face sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I expect in my first therapy session?",
      answer: "Your first session will focus on getting to know you and understanding what brings you to therapy. We'll discuss your goals, background, and I'll explain how I work. It's completely confidential and there's no pressure."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does therapy take to work?",
      answer: "This varies for everyone. Some people notice changes after a few sessions, while others benefit from longer-term work. We'll regularly review your progress and goals together."
    },
    {
      question: "What is psychodynamic therapy?",
      answer: "Psychodynamic therapy explores how your past experiences and unconscious thoughts influence your current relationships and life patterns. It helps you gain insight and make lasting changes."
    },
    {
      question: "Are you qualified and registered?",
      answer: "Yes, I'm BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy) registered with a Master's degree in psychodynamic psychotherapy. I have 6+ years experience working with children, adults and families."
    },
    {
      question: "What issues do you help with?",
      answer: "I work with anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, self-esteem issues, eating disorders, body image concerns, trauma, and life transitions. Both children and adults are welcome."
    },
    {
      question: "Is therapy confidential?",
      answer: "Yes, everything we discuss is strictly confidential. The only exceptions are if there's a risk of serious harm to yourself or others, which I would discuss with you first."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I book a therapy session in Colchester?",
      answer: "You can book through the contact form on my website, call me directly, or email. I respond within 24 hours and offer a free consultation call to answer any questions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with children?",
      answer: "Yes, I specialize in child therapy using play therapy techniques. I work with children experiencing anxiety, emotional difficulties, behavioural concerns, and family changes."
