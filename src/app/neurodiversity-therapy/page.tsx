            <p>
              Every neurodivergent individual has unique strengths, challenges, and ways of
              experiencing the world. Through my experience working in SEN schools, I have developed
              a deep understanding of the complexities and nuances of supporting neurodivergent
              young people in their mental health journey.
            </p>

            <p>
              Neurodiversity encompasses conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia,
              Tourette&apos;s syndrome, and other neurological differences. Rather than viewing
              these as deficits, I approach neurodiversity from a strengths-based perspective,
              recognizing that different neurological wiring brings both unique challenges and
              remarkable abilities.
